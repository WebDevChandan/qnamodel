## Project Title: Question Answering Model in India's Poor-Resourced Language

## Project Overview
This is my College's Major Project. 
The objective of this project is to develop a "Question Answering Model" for Maithili, a language spoken predominantly in Bihar, and Nepal. Maithili is considered one of India's under-resourced languages.

## Tech Stack Used

### Backend
- Built with Python using Bert Transformer for question answering and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
- Utilized the COQA (Conversational Question Answering) dataset for initial training on English and Hindi. Custom Maithili dataset was used to train the model for the Maithili Language.

### FrontEnd
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Tesseract API (for generating text from an image)
- Web APIs (for Speech to Text & Text to Speech Conversion)

## Deployment
- Utilized Flask Web Framework and ngrok Server for deployment.

## Additional Features to Enhance User Experience

### Multiple Input Methods for Textual & Question Data

1. **Microphone Input:**
   Users can utilize their microphone to speak text or questions, and the model will convert their speech into text.

2. **Text File Upload:**
   Users can upload a text file, and the model will fetch the text from the file.

3. **Text Image Upload:**
   In beta mode, this feature allows users to upload an image containing text with a white background, and the model can generate text from the image.

### Responsiveness
The user interface is fully responsive across all devices, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.
